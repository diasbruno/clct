# clct

`clct` is a small Emacs package that highlights coverage information for Common Lisp source files.
It reads companion `.cov` files (sidecar files next to the source file) generated by [cl-coverage-tools](https://github.com/cl-sdk/cl-coverage-tools) and applies underlined overlays to represent coverage states.

## Installation

* **Manually**

Copy `clct.el` into a directory that is part of your `load-path`.
Then add the following to your `init.el` or `.emacs`:

```elisp
(add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/clct/")
(require 'clct)
```

* **Using `use-package`**

If you manage packages with `use-package`, you can load `clct` like this:

```elisp
(use-package clct
  :load-path "/path/to/clct/")
```

## Usage

1. Generate the `.cov` file using `cl-coverage-tools`, e.g.:

2. In the buffer visiting the source file, run:

```
M-x clct-apply-coverage
```

to apply underlined overlays. Use:

```
M-x clct-clear-overlays
```

to remove them.

## Notes

* Faces are customizable via Emacs `defface` facilities (search for `clct-` faces to tweak colors/styles).
